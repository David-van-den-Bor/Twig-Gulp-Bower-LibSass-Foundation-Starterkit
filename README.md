Twig Gulp-Bower LibSass Foundation Starterkit
==================

Starterkit for building static sites compiled with with Twig.js (Gulp port from PHP Twig) It's got Bower and Libsass Foundation baked in. And it compiles html pages with Pretty urls (so "www.yoursite.com/contact" instead of "www.yoursite.com/contact.html")
I have to credit Colyn Brown for showing me what was possible with gulp boilerplates. He made a similar starterkit which I learned from. His starterkit has React JSX compiling and bundling with webpack. If thats your thing you should definitely check it out. https://github.com/colynb/gulp-react-webpack-twig-boilerplate
